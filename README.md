<h1>Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Inspecting Traffic Between Azure Virtual Machines</h1>
In this tutorial, we observe various network traffic to and from Azure Virtual Machines with Wireshark as well as experiment with Network Security Groups. <br />


<h2>Video Demonstration</h2>

- ### [YouTube: Azure Virtual Machines, Wireshark, and Network Security Groups](https://www.youtube.com)

<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Various Command-Line Tools
- Various Network Protocols (SSH, RDH, DNS, HTTP/S, ICMP)
- Wireshark (Protocol Analyzer)

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 10 (21H2)
- Ubuntu Server 20.04

<h2>High-Level Steps</h2>

- Step 1: Deploy Windows 10 and Ubuntu Virtual Machines
- Step 2: Run Windows 10 Virtual Machine and install Wireshark from the net
- Step 3: Connect with Ubuntu VM via PowerShell or command prompt, while observing various network protocols in Wireshark
- Step 4:
